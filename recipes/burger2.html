    <h1>The Bad Effects of Burgers</h1>

    <p>A juicy burger can be an enticing treat for a quick lunch or casual dinner, and you can find a fast-food burger on what seems like every street corner. Despite their deliciousness, however, burgers can contribute to weight gain and have other harmful effects on your health. The healthiest approach is to save burgers for occasional treats and instead select more nutritious alternatives.</p>
    <h2>Watch for Weight Gain</h2>
    <p>You will gain weight if you consume more calories than you expend, and burgers can be high-calorie foods. A double hamburger with mayonnaise contains 942 calories, and your meal can be even higher in calories if you order onion rings or french fries, with 480 calories per large order, and a regular soft drink. A single-patty hamburger without mayo fits better into a diet for weight control, since it has only 232 calories. Another way to limit the calories in your burger is to skip the bun.</p>
    <h2>Guard Your Heart Health</h2>
    <p>Burgers can be high in dietary cholesterol and saturated fat. Dietary cholesterol and saturated fat can raise levels of cholesterol in your blood and increase your risk for heart disease. A double hamburger with mayo contains 22 grams of saturated fat, or 108 percent of the daily value, and 172 milligrams of cholesterol, or 57 percent of the daily value based on a 2,000-calorie diet. Reduce your consumption by choosing a single-patty burger without mayo, which has 4 grams of saturated fat and 26 milligrams of cholesterol. Cholesterol is only in animal-based foods, and a vegetarian burger is cholesterol-free.</p>
